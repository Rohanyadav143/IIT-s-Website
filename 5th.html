        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The institution was founded in 1847 by James Thomason, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western
            Provinces (in which Roorkee then lay) to aid engineers and surveyors at work in the construction of the
            Ganges Canal. It offered instruction catered to a variety of students; this included an engineering class
            for the domiciled British and some Indians; an upper subordinates class for British noncommissioned
            officers; and a lower subordinates class for Indian surveyors. By the mid-1880s, "the school has a hundred
            students, substantial buildings, and a reputation as an important center for the study of hydraulic
            engineering."
            An Electrical Engineering department was added in 1897.The architecture department instituted a master's
            degree course in Architecture (M. Arch.) in 1969–70.
            In 1978, the Institute of Paper Technology, Saharanpur was merged with the then University of Roorkee. The
            Institute of Paper Technology was established as School of Paper Technology by the Government of India in
            1964, with an aid from the Royal Swedish Government. The school was renamed as the Institute of Paper
            Technology in July 1968 and subsequently Department of Paper Technology in July 1992.
            The first edition of Thomso, the institute's annual cultural festival was held in 1982. In 1997 the
            government of India released a stamp dedicated to 150th anniversary of university of Roorkee.
            On 21 September 2001, an ordinance issued by the Government of India declared it as the nation's seventh
            Indian Institute of Technology, renaming it to the current name, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. The
            ordinance was converted into an act by the Parliament to make IIT Roorkee an "Institution of National
            Importance".
            To mark the institute's 175th anniversary in 2022, the central government issued a Rs 175 coin as a gesture
            of commemoration
