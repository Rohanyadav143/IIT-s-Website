        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            In 1956, the West German Government offered technical assistance for establishing an institute of higher
            education in engineering in India. The first Indo-German agreement was signed in Bonn, West Germany in 1959
            for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras. IIT Madras was started with
            technical, academic and financial assistance from the Government of West Germany and was at the time the
            largest international educational project sponsored by the West German government. The Government of the
            Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide the following assistance in the establishment of a higher
            technological institute at Madras:
            A workshop, laboratory equipment, and a library whose total value does not exceed ₹1.8 crore (equivalent to
            ₹166 crores or $20 million in 2023) .
            Twenty German professors to serve at the institute for a period of four to five years
            Four German foremen for the workshops of the institute for two years
            Facilities for the training of twenty Indian teachers in German institutions
            This has led to several collaborative research efforts with universities and institutions in Germany over
            the years. Although official support from the German government has ended, several research efforts
            involving the DAAD programme and Humboldt Fellowships still exist.
            The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras started functioning with the first batch of 120 students being
            admitted in July 1959 to the first year of the Engineering Course.The institute was inaugurated in
            1959, by the then Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. The first batch had an
            overall strength of 120 students from across India. In 1961, the IITs were declared to be Institutes of
            National Importance. The first convocation ceremony was held on 11 July 1964, with Dr. S. Radhakrishnan,
            then the president of India, delivering the convocation address and awarding the degrees to the inaugural
            batch of students. The institute got its first women students in the BTech batch of 1966.IIT Madras
            celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2009, and its Diamond Jubilee in 2019.

    <div id="campus">
        <h1>Campus</h1>
        <p>
            The main entrance of IIT Madras is on Sardar Patel Road, flanked by the residential districts of Adyar and
            Velachery. The campus is close to the Raj Bhavan, the official seat of the Governor of Tamil Nadu. Other
            entrances are located in Velachery (near Anna Garden MTC bus stop, Velachery Main Road), Gandhi Road and
            Taramani gate (close to Ascendas Tech Park).
            The campus is located 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Chennai Airport, 12 km (7.5 mi) from the Chennai Central
            Railway station, and is connected by city buses. Kasturba Nagar is the nearest station on the Chennai MRTS
            line.
            Two parallel roads, Bonn Avenue and Delhi Avenue, cut through the faculty residential area before they meet
            at the Gajendra Circle, near the Administrative Block. Buses regularly ply between the Main Gate, Gajendra
            Circle, the Academic Zone, and the Hostel Zone.
            It is likely to set up an offshore campus in Tanzania in Africa as part of the Central govt's IIT expansion
            plans in abroad. In July 2023, education officials of India and Tanzania said that an IIT Madras
            satellite campus in the Tanzanian autonomous territory of Zanzibar would begin offering classes in October
            2023.

        <h1>Academics</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Madras offers undergraduate, postgraduate and research degrees across 17 disciplines in Engineering,
            Science, Humanities and Management.About 600 faculty belonging to science and engineering departments
            and centres of the institute are engaged in teaching, research and industrial consultancy.
            The institute has 16 academic departments and advanced research centres across disciplines of engineering
            and pure sciences, with nearly 100 laboratories. The academic calendar is organised around the semester.
            Each semester provides a minimum of seventy days of instruction in English. Students are evaluated on a
            continuous basis throughout the semester. Evaluation is done by the faculty, a consequence of the autonomous
            status granted to the institute. Research work is evaluated on the basis of the review thesis by peer
            examiners both from within the country and abroad. Ordinances that govern the academic programme of study
            are prepared by the Senate, the highest academic body within the institute.
            IITM is also gearing up to launch a new and completely online BEd degree programme in Maths and Computing to
            improve maths teaching in schools, as said by the director at the G20 seminar at IIT Madras
