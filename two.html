                    The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are centrally funded technical institutes located across
                    India. They are under the ownership of the Ministry of Education of the Government of India and are
                    governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961. The Act declares them as Institutes of National
                    Importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance as the country's premier
                    institutions in the field of technology.[2][3] The act currently lists twenty-three IITs.[4] Each
                    IIT has autonomy and is linked to others through a common council called the IIT Council, which
                    oversees their administration. The Minister of Education of India is the ex officio chairperson of
                    the IIT Council.

                Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru pioneered establishing of the Indian Institutes of Technology to provide trained
                technical personnel of international class to the nation who would act as leaders in technology for the
                newly born independent India. The institutions were to be designed with the necessary dynamism,
                flexibility of organization and capacity to adapt in the light of expanding knowledge and changes in the
                socio-economic requirements of modern society.
                In May 1950, the first in the series was established in Kharagpur at the site of the Hijli Detention
                Camp, where the British had incarcerated political prisoners, the institution was named the 'Indian
                Institute of Technology' before its formal inauguration on August 18, 1951.
                Within a decade of the launch of the first IIT, four more were set up: IIT Bombay (1958), IIT Madras
                (1959), IIT Kanpur (1959), and IIT Delhi (1961). Decades later, the sixth IIT was established in
                Guwahati (1994). India's first technical institute, set up in 1847 and known as the Thomson College of
                Engineering and subsequently the University of Roorkee, was ordained as the seventh IIT in September
                2001. In the year 2008, six new IITs were started: IIT Bhubaneswar, IIT Gandhinagar, IIT Hyderabad, IIT
                Patna, IIT Rajasthan, and IIT Ropar. This was followed by two more IITs in 2009: IIT Indore and IIT
                Mandi. In 2012, Institute of Technology, BHU was designated the sixteenth IIT. IIT Palakkad and IIT
                Tirupati came into existence in 2015, and in 2016 five more IITs; IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, IIT Bhilai, IIT
                Goa, IIT Jammu and IIT Dharwad were started.
                During the early years, the IITs benefited in varying degrees from material assistance and academic
                cooperation from developed countries --- IIT Bombay from the Soviet Union, IIT Madras from Germany, IIT
                Kanpur from the United States, and IIT Delhi from the United Kingdom. Over the years IITs have created
                world class educational platforms dynamically sustained through internationally recognized research
                based on excellent infrastructural facilities. The faculty and alumni of IITs have made huge impact in
                all sectors of society, both in India and abroad. The institutes are globally recognized as centres of
                academic excellence, and are reputed for the outstanding caliber of the students graduating from them.
