        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Kanpur was established by an Act of Parliament in 1960 by the Government of India. The institute was
            started in December 1959 in a room in the canteen building of the Harcourt Butler Technological Institute at
            Agricultural Gardens in Kanpur. In 1963, the institute moved to its present location, on the Grand Trunk
            Road near Kalyanpur locality in Kanpur district.The campus was designed by Achyut Kavinde in a modernist
            style.
            During the first ten years of its existence, a consortium of nine US universities (namely MIT, UCB,
            California Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Carnegie Institute of Technology, University of
            Michigan, Ohio State University, Case Institute of Technology and Purdue University) helped set up IIT
            Kanpur's research laboratories and academic programmes under the Kanpur Indo-American Programme (KIAP).
            The first director of the institute was P. K. Kelkar (after whom the Central Library was renamed in
            2002).
            Under the guidance of economist John Kenneth Galbraith, IIT Kanpur was the first institute in India to offer
            Computer science education.The earliest computer course was started at the institute in August 1963
            on an IBM 1620 system. The initiative for computer education came from the Electrical engineering
            department, then under the chairmanship of Prof. H.K. Kesavan, who was concurrently the chairman of
            Electrical Engineering and head of the Computer Centre. Prof. Harry Huskey of the University of California,
            Berkeley, who preceded Kesavan, helped with the computer activity at IIT-Kanpur.In 1971, the
            institute began an independent academic program in Computer Science and Engineering, leading to MTech and
            PhD degrees.
            In 1972 the KIAP program ended, in part because of political tensions between India and Pakistan (as the USA
            supported Pakistan). Government funding was also reduced as a reaction to the sentiment that the IIT's were
            contributing to the brain drain.
            The institute's annual technical festival, Techkriti, was first started in 1995.

        <h1>Campus</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Kanpur is located on the Grand Trunk Road, 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) west of Kanpur City and measures close
            to 420 hectares (1,000 acres). This land was donated by the Government of Uttar Pradesh in 1960 and by March
            1963 the institute had moved to its current location.
            PK Kelkar Library
            The institute has around 6478 students with 3938 undergraduate students and 2540 postgraduate students and
            about 500 research associates.
            The academic area comprises the central library, departmental buildings, research centres, lecture hall
            complex, tutorial block and auditorium. The student hostels and other facilities like Student Activities
            Centre (SAC), Sports Complex lie outside the academic area. There are 15 Halls of Residence which are
            allotted to undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students. Additionally, married research scholars are
            allotted Single Bedroom Apartment (SBRA) facility on campus

        <h1>Academics</h1>
        <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
        <p>
            IIT Kanpur offers four-year B.Tech programs in Aerospace Engineering, Biological Sciences and
            Bio-engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical
            Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. The admission to these programs
            is procured through Joint Entrance Examination. IITK offers admission only to bachelor's degree now
            (discontinuing the integrated course programs), but it can be extended by 1 year to make it integrated,
            depending on the choice of student and based on his/her performance there at undergraduate level. IIT Kanpur
            also offers four-year B.S. Programs in Pure and Applied Sciences (Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in
            particular), Earth Science and Economics.
        </p>
        <h2>New academic system</h2>
        <p>
            From 2011, IIT Kanpur has started offering a four-year BS program in sciences and has kept its BTech Program
            intact. Entry to the five-year MTech/MBA programs and Dual degree programme will be done based on the CPI of
            students instead of JEE rank.In order to reduce the number of student exams, IIT Kanpur has also
            abolished the earlier system of conducting two mid-term examinations. Instead, only two examinations (plus
            two quizzes in most courses depending on the instructor-in-charge, one before mid-semesters and the other
            after the mid-semesters and before the end-semesters examination), one between the semester and other
            towards the end of it would be held from the academic session starting July 2011 onward as per Academic
            Review Committee's recommendations.
        </p>
        <h2>Postgraduate</h2>
        <p>
            Postgraduate courses in Engineering offer Master of Technology (MTech), MS (R) and PhD(Doctor of Philosophy)
            degrees. The institute also offers two-tier MSc(Master of Science) courses in areas of basic sciences in
            which students are admitted through Joint Admission Test for MSc (JAM) exam. The institute also offers
            M.Des. (2 years), M.B.A. (2 years) and MSc (2 years) degrees. Admissions to MTech is made once a year
            through Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering. Admissions to M. Des are made once a year through both
            Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) and Common Entrance Exam for Design (CEED). Until 2011,
            admissions to the M.B.A. program were accomplished through the Joint Management Entrance Test (JMET), held
            yearly, and followed by a Group Discussion/Personal Interview process. In 2011, JMET was replaced by Common
            Admission Test (CAT).

        <p>
            The Computer Centre is one of the most advanced computing service centres among academic institution in
            India. It hosts the IIT Kanpur website and provides personal web space for students and faculties. It also
            provides a spam filtered email server and high speed fibre optic Internet to all the hostels and the
            academic areas. Users have multiple options to choose among various interfaces to access mail service. It
            has Linux and windows laboratories equipped with dozens of high-end software like MATLAB, Autocad, Ansys,
            Abaqus etc. for use of students. Apart from departmental computer labs, computer centre hosts more than 300
            Linux terminals and more than 100 Windows terminals and is continuously available to the students for
            academic work and recreation. Computer centre has recently adopted an open source software policy for its
            infrastructure and computing. Various high-end compute and GPU servers are remotely available from data
            centre for user computation.
            The computer centre has multiple super computing clusters for research and teaching activity. In June 2014
            IIT Kanpur launched their second supercomputer which is India's fifth most powerful supercomputer as of
            now. The new supercomputer 'Cluster Platform SL230s Gen8' manufactured by Hewlett-Packard has 15,360 cores
            and a theoretical peak (Rpeak) 307.2 TFlop/s and is the world's 192nd most powerful supercomputer as of June
            2015.Recently, IIT Kanpur has developed a compressed air-based mineral transport system. The project
            was presented at the Global Investors Summit, in 2023. It received good feedback for its less material loss,
            reduced air pollution, and efficiency to reduce travel time to a great extent. The main objective of the
            system is to transport coal and slurry.
