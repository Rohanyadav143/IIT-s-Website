        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Ropar was established by MHRD in 2008. The classes for academic session 2008–2009 were held at IIT
            Delhi. The Institute started functioning from its transit campus in Rupnagar from 1st August 2009.[6][7]
            Foundation stone for the permanent campus of IIT Ropar was laid down on 24 February 2009 by the then Union
            HRD Minister Shri Arjun Singh

    <div id="campus">
        <h1>Campus</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Ropar has shifted to its permanent campus since June 2019, except for the departments of Humanities,
            Mathematics, Physics, Chemical Engineering and Civil Engineering, and some hostels and labs.[8] Architecture
            of the entrance gate is inspired by Indus Valley civilisation with four 41 feet high stone carved[9] pillars
            at the entrance.[10][11][12] The institute started to operate from its permanent campus in July 2018. Some
            phases of this campus were still under construction. The campus was being built on the land earlier known as
            Birla Seed Farms. It is located over an area of 525 acres (2.12 km2). IIT Ropar celebrates its Foundation
            Day on 24 February every year. The contract was given to CPWD and a Bangkok-based construction company was
            assigned the task of finishing the first phase.[13] The Computer Science Department has been shifted to this
            campus in July 2018. A part of the administration office was shifted on 17 June 2018. In June 2019, the
            Administration and Departments of Electrical, Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering completely shifted
            to the permanent campus.
