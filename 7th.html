            IIT Delhi, officially the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, is a public institute of technology located
            in Delhi, India. It is one of the 23 Indian Institutes of Technology created to be Centre of Excellence for
            India's training, research and development in science, engineering and technology.
            Established in 1961, it was formally inaugurated in August 1961 by Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific
            Research & Cultural Affairs. The first admissions were made in 1961. The current campus has an area of 320
            acres (or 1.3 km2) and is bound by the Sri Aurobindo Marg on the east, the Jawaharlal Nehru University
            Complex on the west, the National Council of Educational Research and Training on the south, and the New
            Ring Road on the north. It is flanked by Qutb Minar and the Hauz Khas monuments.
            The institute was later decreed in the Institutes of National Importance under the Institutes of Technology
            Amendment Act, 1963, and accorded the status of a full University with powers to decide its academic policy,

    <div id="history">
        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The concept of IIT was first introduced by Sh. N.M. Sircar, then a Member of Education on the Viceroy's
            executive council. Following his recommendations, the first Indian Institute of Technology was established
            in the year 1950 in Kharagpur. In his report, Shri Sircar suggested that such Institutes should also be
            started in different parts of the country. The Government having accepted these recommendations of the
            Sircar Committee decided to establish more Institutes of Technology with the assistance of friendly
            countries who were prepared to help. The first offer of help came from the USSR who agreed to collaborate in
            the establishment of an Institute through UNESCO in Bombay. This was followed by the Institutes of
            Technology at Madras, Kanpur, and Delhi with collaborations with West Germany, the United States, and UK
            respectively.[citation needed]
            H.R.H. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh laid the foundation stone of the college at Hauz Khas on 28 January
            1959 during his visit to India. The first admissions were made in 1961. The College of Engineering &
            Technology was registered as a society on 14 June 1960 under the Societies Registration Act No. XXI of 1860
            (Registration No. S1663 of 1960–61). The students were asked to report at the college on 16 August 1961, and
            the college was formally inaugurated on 17 August 1961 by Humayun Kabir, Minister of Scientific Research &
            Cultural Affairs. Initially, the college ran in the Kashmiri Gate campus of Delhi College of Engineering
            (now known as Delhi Technological University) before shifting to its permanent campus in Hauz Khas. The
            Department of Textile Technology of Delhi College of Engineering was shifted out en bloc to mark the
            beginning of the IIT Delhi at its new campus at Hauz Khas. The college was later accorded the status of a
            university and was renamed as Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.IIT Delhi celebrated its Golden
            Jubilee in 2011, and its Diamond Jubilee in 2021.
            In 2018, IIT Delhi was one of the first six institutes to be awarded the Institute of Eminence status.
            According to a government statement issued earlier, these IoEs will have greater autonomy in that they will
            be able to admit foreign students up to 30% of the admitted students and recruit foreign faculty up to 25%
            of the faculty strength with enhanced research funding.
            In July 2023, IIT Delhi signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish the first global campus of
            IIT-Delhi in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
