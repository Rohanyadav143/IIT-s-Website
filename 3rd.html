        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Bombay was the second Indian Institute of Technology to be established in 1958 with assistance from
            UNESCO and with funds contributed by the Soviet Union.UNESCO agreed to provide equipment and technical
            experts mainly from the Soviet Union, while the Government of India accepted the responsibility for all
            other expenses including the cost of the building project and recurring expenses. The site chosen for the
            institute was Powai with an area of 550 acres (2.2 km2) which was given by the then Bombay State Government.
            While construction was being completed, the first academic session of the institute opened on 25 July 1958,
            in its temporary home at the Synthetic and Art Silk Mills Research Association (SASMIRA) building in Worli
            with 100 students.The following is the present position regarding the assistance received from
            UNESCO under the UN Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance:
            Equipment costing Rs.57,35,000 has so far been received (USSR—Rs.55,50,000; UK—Rs.1,50,000; USA—Rs.18,000
            and Germany—Rs.19,000)
            12 Progressors (10 Russians, 1 American and 1 Yugoslavian) and 3 Russians Translators are working at the
            Institution.
            For advanced training in USSR, 4 Indian teachers were deputed in 1958 and 6 more teachers were selected.
            These students were selected from over 3,400 applicants for admission to the first year undergraduate
            engineering programmes of Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering Physics, Energy,
            Mechanical, Metallurgical Engineering, and MSc Chemistry.[citation needed] One of the main objectives of
            establishing the institute was to develop facilities for studies in a variety of specialized engineering and
            technological sciences. The need for establishing adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research
            was kept uppermost in mind in the founding years. While the institute was functioning provisionally at
            Worli, an effort was made to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and
            Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on 10 March 1959.
            On July 9, 2018, IIT Bombay was conferred the status of Institute of Eminence by the Ministry of Human
            Resources & Development, along with 5 other institutes in India which would provide it additional autonomy
            and government funds

        <h1>Campus</h1>
        <p>
            The IIT Bombay campus, having an area of about 545 acres, is located at Powai, in East Mumbai, between the
            Vihar and Powai lakes. The campus is divided into clusters of buildings. The academic area chiefly comprises
            the main building, various departmental annexes and auditoria. All department annexes are connected by a
            corridor named Infinite Corridor. Beyond the Convocation Hall lie most of the hostels. There are a total of
            18 hostels, of which two hostels (Hostels 10 and 11) and a wing of the newly constructed hostel (Hostel 15)
            are for female students.
            Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has significant green cover and is
            mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest of the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park
            has also led to occasional sightings of leopards and mugger crocodiles along the banks of the Powai lake.
            Sometimes they stray into the campus in search of prey.
            The campus has also recorded over 200 species of birds including Indian grey hornbill, Indian pitta,
            Vigors's sunbird, Ashy prinia, Indian paradise flycatcher, Rufous woodpecker, and Oriental darter.[18]
            The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey and cricket grounds; and tennis, basketball, squash
            and volleyball courts. It also has a Students' Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and other
            extracurricular activities. In addition to these facilities, the campus also houses two high schools, one of
            which is a Kendriya Vidyalaya and the other is called IIT Campus School.

            students, professors, and non-academic staffs.
            In 2015 the National Virtual Academy for Indian Agriculture launched a free online agriculture course in
            collaboration with ICRISAT Hyderabad and IIT Bombay.[29] From July 2016, IIT Bombay is planning to offer a
            four-year undergraduate programme in economics
