        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            Establishing an IIT in Odisha was a long-standing demand for several decades. As the state ranked at the bottom in terms of centrally funded academic and research institutions, there were strong allegations of Congress led central government neglect.[5][6] There were several incidents of protest, both locally in Odisha,[7][8][9][10][11][12] the National Students Union of India (NSUI),[13] and eminent nonresident Indian academics. An organization called Agamee Odisha was formed, that spearheaded mass agitation throughout the state.[11][12] There also have been stray incidents of violence related to the issue of Odisha's neglect.[14] Politicians including the Chief Minister of Odisha, Naveen Patnaik, cast this festering issue as a sign of severe neglect of the state by the UPA government in New Delhi.[15][16][17][18][19][20] In May 2007, this became a major issue in the Indian parliament.[21][22][23][24] The opposition NDA staged a walk-out in the Indian parliament, accusing the ruling UPA of neglecting the state's economic development.[25][26][27] Sections of the media reported that the Congress party led UPA government had been embarrassed by this issue.[28] Eventually, the HRD minister Mr. Arjun Singh relented, leading to the inception of IIT Bhubaneswar.
