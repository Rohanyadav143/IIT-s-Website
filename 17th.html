        <h1>Infrastructure Development</h1>
        <p>
            The Institute started its operations in 2015 from a temporary campus on the Tirupati Renigunta Road. The Government of Andhra Pradesh has provided a picturesque 548 acres of land for the development of the permanent campus for the Institute.  The campus is being developed in multiple stages. A master plan has been prepared to build a campus to cater to 12,000 students while conserving its ecological features. IIT Tirupati set a goal that the first batch should live at least one year in the permanent campus and achieved the target. The Stage 1A campus consisting of laboratories, hostels, classrooms and sports facilities was completed by 2018 by using prefab and sustainable technologies.  Subsequently, the Stage 1B project consisting of a hostel building, a classroom complex building and an engineering unit building were completed by the end of 2019. Currently, the Stage 1C project is under construction. In the academic zone, the buildings under construction include two Department Buildings that will have offices for about 100 faculty members and the associated laboratories, a Central Instrumentation Facility, a Lecture Hall Complex and Administrative Building. In the hostel zone, two hostels with 1,000 rooms, a Central Dining facility and sports facilities are under construction. In the residential zone, 168 apartments for faculty and staff, a 20 room guest house and Director's Bungalow are under construction. The external services for power, water, wastewater handling and roads are also under construction as part of this package. Two lakes over 10 acres are being created to store water. The architects for the project include M/s Suresh Goel and Associates, Delhi and M/s ADPL, Delhi. The construction projects are being implemented through CPWD. The contractor for the Stage 1C project is M/s JMC Projects Ltd. The Third-Party Quality Assurance is being provided by CUBE, IIT Madras. In spite of the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the project team has been able to make significant progress. The contract for the Stage 1C project was awarded on 20 March, 2020. However, due to the nationwide lockdown, the contractor M/s JMC Projects was able to start mobilization only after Unlock 1.0 was announced during the first week of June 2020. Viswakarma Awas, the workers' colony set up by the JMC Projects on a six acres plot in the campus is a model construction workers colony consisting of housing, RO water supply, STP for sewerage treatment, medical center, children's school and gardens.
