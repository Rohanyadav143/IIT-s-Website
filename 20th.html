            Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad (IIT Dharwad or IIT DH) is an autonomous engineering and technology
            institute in Dharwad, Karnataka, India. IIT Dharwad started functioning from July 2016 in a temporary
            campus, previously of the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) in Belur Industrial Area, on the
            outskirts of Dharwad city.[3] It was formally inaugurated on 28 August 2016.[4] For the academic year
            2016–2017, the institute offered B.Tech courses in three branches, namely. Electrical Engineering, Computer
            Science, and Mechanical Engineering.[5] The year 2021 saw the introduction of an additional branch,
            Engineering physics. As of 2022, the institute expanded to provide four additional courses of study, namely
            Chemical and Biochemical engineering, Mathematics and Computing, Civil and Infrastructure engineering, and
            Interdisciplinary Sciences.

            As part of the mentorship plan, IIT Bombay is the mentor institute for IIT Dharwad. The HRD Ministry has set
            up an IIT monitoring cell at IIT Bombay. The committee members were designated as officials on special duty
            to supervise the process of setting up IIT Dharwad.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The late Union Human Resources Development Minister S. R. Bommai had moved the proposal to the Centre
            seeking an IIT in Dharwad in the 1990s. In 1998, a committee headed by former ISRO chairman and space
            scientist Udupi Ramachandra Rao submitted its report recommending an IIT in Hubballi-Dharwad.[3][8] Union
            finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the 2015-16 union budget, sanctioned a budget for IIT for Karnataka state
            and the state government suggested three locations. The short-listed cities were Dharwad, Mysuru, and
            Raichur

            identified for the IIT campus, but that deal was cancelled due to legal hurdles. The State Cabinet decided

            The city also houses educational institutions like Karnatak University, Karnatak College, University of
            Agricultural Sciences, SDMCET .[12] Also, new institutes like the IIIT Dharwad[13] are coming up in the twin
