        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Gandhinagar is one of the eight Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) announced by the Ministry of Human Resource Development in 2008.[5][6] The institute began operating in a temporary campus at Vishwakarma Government Engineering College, Chandkheda, mentored by Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The first batch of students was admitted to three programmes: Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.[7]
            IITGN was included in the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011.[8] The Act was passed in the Lok Sabha on 24 March 2011[9] and by the Rajya Sabha on 30 April 2012.[10] The IIT Gandhinagar campus is located on the banks of the Sabarmati River in Palaj village.[11] In 2011, in his inaugural speech at the Amalthea technology summit, then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi spoke of the land for the new permanent campus, saying, "the state government has decided to give land on 99 year lease with a token amount of just one rupee for setting up a campus of IIT-Gandhinagar."[12] The institute took possession of over 400 acres of land in August 2012,[4] and classes and other activities on the new campus began in July 2015.[13]
            The 400-acre campus of IITGN is situated on the banks of the Sabarmati river in Palaj village.[14] The campus has three rough divisions: Academic Block, Housing Block, and Student Hostels. This campus is India's first 5-star GRIHA LD campus for minimizing the negative effect on the environment. IITGN has also been bestowed with FSSAI's 'Eat Right Campus' with a 5-star rating and is the first (and only) academic campus to be declared so.
