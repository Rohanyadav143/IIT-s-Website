        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The Indian National Congress at its XVII Session of December 1901 passed a resolution stating that:[11][12]

            The Indian National Congress is of opinion that a Government College of Mining Engineering be established in
            some suitable place in India on the models of the Royal School of Mines in England...

            The McPherson Committee formed by Government of British India, recommended the establishment of an
            institution for imparting education in the fields of mining and geology, whose report, submitted in 1920
            along with approach of Indian Mine Managers' of India in 1924, formed the main basis for establishment of
            the Indian School of Mines & Applied Geology at Dhanbad on 9 December 1926.[5][13] From 1926 to 1946 it was
            led by Prof F. W. Sharpley.[14]

            The institute originally offered courses mainly in Mining Engineering and Applied Geology when it opened. In
            1957, the institute began offering courses in Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics and the name was
            changed to Indian School of Mines. Up to 1967, it was a government institute where the faculties were
            recruited through Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).

            The school was granted university status by the University Grants Commission under the University Grants
            Commission Act, 1956 in 1967. Later courses in Mining Machinery Engineering and Mineral Engineering were
            started in 1975 and 1976 respectively. It was among the few institutes to start courses in Industrial
            Engineering and Management (in 1977), to cater to the needs of industries like metallurgy, mining and
            manufacturing.

            From 1996 to 1997 the school came directly under the financial and administrative controls of Ministry of
            Human Resource Development, Government of India with pay scales and perks to its employees at par with that
            of Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management. In 1997, the institute began
            admitting students through the IIT Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE) conducted jointly by the IITs and
            ISM.[15] In 1998 courses for Electronics Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering were introduced
            and in 1999, the institute started a bachelor of technology course in Mechanical Engineering.

            In 2006, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad added 14 new courses, prominent among them being Electrical Engineering and a
            course in Environmental Engineering in the undergraduate curriculum. From 2006, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad also
            started offering Integrated Master of Science (Int. MSc) in Applied Physics, Applied Chemistry and
            Mathematics & Computing, and Integrated Master of Science and Technology (Int. MSc Tech) courses for Applied
            Geology and Applied Geophysics. In 2011, the institute offered a BTech programme in Chemical Engineering.
            The institute introduced Civil Engineering in 2013 and Engineering Physics in 2014.
