        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            In 1946, a committee by Sir Jogendra Singh, Member of Viceroy's executive council, to consider the creation
            of higher technical institutions "for post-World War II industrial development of India". This was followed
            by the creation of a 22-member committee headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. In its interim report, the Sarkar
            Committee recommended the establishment of higher technical institutions in India, along the lines of the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulting from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign
            along with affiliated secondary institutions. The report urged that work should start with the speedy
            establishment of major institutions in the four-quarters of the country with the ones in the east and the
            west to be set up immediately.

            On the grounds that West Bengal had the highest concentration of industries at the time, Bidhan Chandra Roy,
            the Chief Minister of West Bengal, persuaded Jawaharlal Nehru (India's first prime minister) to establish
            the first institute in West Bengal. The first Indian Institute of Technology was thus established in May
            1950 as the Eastern Higher Technical Institute.It was located in Esplanade East, Calcutta, and in
            September 1950 shifted to its permanent campus at Hijli, Kharagpur 120 kilometres (75 mi) south-west of
            Kolkata (formerly called Calcutta). Hijli had been used as a detention camp during the period of British
            rule in India, where Indian independence activists were imprisoned.
            IIT Kharagpur is the 4th oldest technical institute in the West Bengal state after IIEST, Shibpur
            (established as B.E. College in 1856), Jadavpur University (established as Bengal technical institute in
            1906) and Rajabazar Science College (established as Calcutta University campus for Science and Technology in
            1914). When the first session started in August 1951, there were 224 students and 42 teachers in the ten
            departments of the institute. The classrooms, laboratories and the administrative office were housed in the
            historic building of the Hijli Detention Camp (now known as Shaheed Bhawan), where political revolutionaries
            were imprisoned during the period of British colonial rule.[9] The office building had served as the
            headquarters of the Bomber Command of the U.S. 20th Air Force during World War II.

        <h1>Campus</h1>
        <p>
            IIT Kharagpur is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) west of Kolkata. The campus is located five kilometres away
            from Kharagpur Railway Station in West Midnapore district. The layout of the present campus and the design
            of the buildings were carried out by a group of engineers and architects under the guidance of Werner M.
            Moser, a Swiss architect.The 8.5-square-kilometre (2,100-acre) campus is residence to about 22,000
            inhabitants.In 2015, IIT Kharagpur had about 605 faculty members, 1,933 employees and approximately
            10,010 students living on the campus.The campus has a total of 55 kilometres (34 miles) of roadways.
            The Institute plans to go Green by 2020.
            The 22 student hostels are located on either side of Scholars Avenue, which extends from the institute gate
            to the B. C. Roy Technology Hospital. The three earliest halls—Patel, Azad, and Nehru—together constitute
            the PAN loop or Old Campus, which is located just next to Scholar's Avenue. There are ten hostels for
            undergraduate male students (MMM, LBS, RP, RK, MS, LLR, HJB, Patel, Azad and Nehru) and two for
            undergraduate female students (SN/IG and MT). There are a few post-graduate students' hostels including four
            for women(RLB, Gokhle, Nivedita and SAM) and hostels for research scholars (BCR, VS, BRH and JCB) and a
            separate hostel for scholars from the armed forces.The Jnan Ghosh stadium and Tata Sports Complex host
            large-scale sports competitions. The Tagore Open Air Theatre has a capacity of 6,000 people, and is used to
            host cultural programs.The Science and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park (STEP) provides infrastructure
            facilities to alumni who want to become entrepreneurs but lack infrastructure to start their own
            corporation.
            In addition to the main campus at Kharagpur, the institute has an extension centre at Kolkata to provide
            venues for continuing education programmes, distance learning courses, and guesthouse accommodation. The
            institute has Kolkata extension centre at Rajarhat and usea it to offer some full-time undergraduate and
            postgraduate courses.The 4-hectare (10-acre) Rajarhat campus houses 2,500 students.[22] The institute's
            plan for a similar branch campus of 0.81 square kilometres (200 acres) in Bhubaneswar was scrapped following
            rejection by the Union Human Resource and Development ministry.
            The Ministry of human resource development on 5 September 2019 awarded "Institute of Eminence" status to IIT
            Kharagpur along with four public institution in India, which will enable to get full autonomy and special
            incentives.
