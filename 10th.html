            IIT Hyderabad was established by the Ministry of Education, Government of India under the Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011. The Act was passed in the Lok Sabha on 24 March 2011[6] and by the Rajya Sabha on 30 April 2012.[7] It was set up in technical and financial assistance from Government of Japan.
            IIT Hyderabad began functioning on 18 August 2008 from a temporary campus in Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited, with Prof. U. B. Desai as the founding director. In July 2015, it moved to its ~600-acre permanent campus at Kandi, Sangareddy. At present, Prof B S Murty is the Director of IIT Hyderabad.

        <p>
            The IITH campus is on a land area of 576 acres (234 ha). Despite being called IIT Hyderabad, its campus is about 60 km from main Hyderabad city. The academic building is designed by New Delhi-based ARCOP and hostels, Lecture Hall and academic departments by Pune-based acclaimed American architect, Prof. Christopher Charles Benninger. This organic campus is divided into clusters of buildings being completed in phases starting in 2011. The campus is one of India's best examples of energy efficient, carbon neutral and sustainable architecture. The design grew out of local weather conditions and utmost care to enhance learning. The graduate and post-graduate programs are separated, student and teacher housing is divided, and girls and boys hostels are segregated for a pluralistic environment.
            The 25 lakh square feet of buildings in Phase 1A; 3 academic blocks and 10 functioning hostel buildings (each with a capacity of 200) were completed in March 2019
